## Icons

In course materials, I will use the following icons to signal to you how I intend for us to interact during that portion of class:

 - <img src='../icons/reading.png' style="height: 50px"/> "Reading" signifies reading you should do outside of class.
 
 - <img src='../icons/observe.png' style="height: 50px"/> "Observe" is direct instruction; i.e. a lecture or example. You should observe, watch, listen, and ask questions.  

 - <img src='../icons/laptop.png' style='height: 50px'/> "Laptop" signifies a hands on activity you should work through. Please bring a laptop to class for this purpose. When we don't work through these in class, please do so on your own.

## <img src="../icons/observe.png" style="height: 100px"/>  Demonstrations and examples
 + When you see the "observe" icon, you should expect to watch, listen and *ask questions* but not expect the pacing to allow you to follow along at your laptop.
 
 + If you find it difficult to keep up during the in-class demonstrations consider:
    
    - Putting your computer away and focusing on the key commands or concepts being demonstrated.
    
    - Asking questions in class or jotting down questions to research / ask later.
    
    - Work out syntax and details at your own pace after class.

##  <img src="../icons/QuestionsWelcome.png" style="height: 70px"/> Questions

 +  *Relevant* questions are always welcome during lectures. 
 
 + When you ask a  question, if I don't call you by name please state your name before asking the question.
 
 + Although we will set aside time in class for activities and exercises please remember that this is not a lab course.

##  <img src="../icons/QuestionsWelcome.png" style="height: 70px"/> Questions

 + Questions about syntax should be asked:
    
    - When a command is being introduced or used in class 
    - In office hours, **after** reading the documentation and/or performing
    and internet search.
    
 + Think about the scope of your question:
 
    - Is it relevant to the current topic? 
    
        + Yes $\to$ ask now
       
        + No $\to$ ask later

    - Am I likely to find the answer on my own? If "yes" try do so first and then ask if you're still unsure after some research.


## <img src="../icons/reading.png" style="height: 70px"/> Readings

 + I plan to cover topics in more depth at the expense of breadth. You will
 have to make up for the lack of breadth through reading and exercises.

 + I encourage you to ask questions about the readings at the start of classes.

 + You should plan to spend 1hr per week for readings, on average. 
 
 + You do not need to read all the software documentation linked to under resources,  but should learn to find relevant information there. 
 
## <img src='../icons/laptop.png' style="height: 100px"/> Exercises and Examples

 + Around once a week, we will take time to work through exercices and similar activities in class.  Please bring a laptop to class or sit next to someone with a laptop for this purpose. 
 
 + After each class, set aside time to work through the examples and exercises discussed in class. 
 
 + <img src='../icons/QuestionsWelcome.png' style="height: 50px"/> Questions about examples and exercises from previous lectures are always welcome in office hours and at the start of class.
 
## Establishing a review workflow

 + If you are working remotely (on a server) log-on and move to a directory you've 
 created to organize your work, i.e. 


>   ssh uniqname@scs.dsc.umich.edu
 
   
>   cd 506/

 
 + Refer to the first reading assignment or ask in office hours for help with this.

 + Visit the course website and copy the address of a script.
 
 + Use `wget` to download the script to your local directory.
 
 + Open the relevant program (i.e. Stata, R, etc) and work through the script line by line.
 Use help to understand the syntax.
