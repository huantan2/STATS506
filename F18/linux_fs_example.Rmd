## ![](../icons/Laptop.png){width='18px'} Example / Exercise 

1. Connect: `ssh login.itd.umich.edu`
1. Print host: `hostname`
1. Print working directory: `pwd`
1. Create a directory: `mkdir 506`
1. Move to that directory: `cd 506`
1. Create a basic `README.md` to document 
your work in this folder: 
    - `echo "## Stats 506" > README.md`
    - Append a blank line `echo " " >> README.md`
    
1. Create additional directories: 
    - `mkdir ./hw; mkdir ./examples`
    - `mkdir ./data && mkdir ./data/csv`
1. Create multiple directories using a loop

```bash
for d in R Stata SAS sh
do
  mkdir ./examples/$d
  echo $d
done
```  

Note the use of `;` to execute multiple commands on the same line.
It isn't needed here, but `&&` is used to execute the second command only if
the first completes successfully. You can, but are not required to, read more about exit status and exit codes [here](https://bencane.com/2014/09/02/understanding-exit-codes-and-how-to-use-them-in-bash-scripts/).
