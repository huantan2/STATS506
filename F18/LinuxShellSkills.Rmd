## ![](../icons/reading.png){width='25px'} Readings 

The readings below are assigned through Canvas:

1. [Linux Shell Skills](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~kshedden/Courses/Stat506/linux-shell/)
from Prof. Shedden's 2016 Course notes

2. [A tmux Primer](https://danielmiessler.com/study/tmux/) by Daniel Meissler

3. [Statistics and Computation Service ](http://www.itcs.umich.edu/scs/) by UM ITS

## ![](../icons/Observe.png){width='25px'} Getting Started

If you are using a computer running a Mac or linux OS you have access to a linux terminal installed on your computer as *Terminal*.

If you are using a computer running a Windows OS, you will need to install a
terminal or shell proram capable of acting as such.  Most people use [Putty](https://www.putty.org/) but 
[Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/getting-started/getting-started-with-windows-powershell?view=powershell-6)  may also be an option.

Experienced users may be interested in [zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/) but
we will not make use of it for this class.

## ![](../icons/Observe.png){width='25px'} Connecting to UM Machines  

### AFS
In order to connect to university linux servers, you need to have an
AFS home directory.  If you do not have one, you can set it up by visiting
http://mfile.umich.edu/ and selecting the 'AFS Self-Provisioning Tool'. 

### Hosts
You can connect to a UM linux server using `ssh` as follows:

```bash
  ssh uniqname@login.itd.umich.edu
  ssh uniqname@scs.dsc.umich.edu
  ssh uniqname@mario.dsc.umich.edu
  ssh uniqname@luigi.dsc.umich.edu
```

Replace uniqname with your UM unique name which is same as the first part of 
your UM email address.

### Trouble connecting

If you have trouble connecting to the SCS servers please visit this
[help page](http://www.itcs.umich.edu/scs/access_problems.php).

### ![](../icons/Laptop.png){width='18px'} Exercises 

1. In a web browser, visit https://mfile.umich.edu and login to view your files. If needed, use the self-provisioning tool first.
1. Find or install your terminal program and open it.
1. Connect to `scs.dsc.umich.edu` using `ssh`. Which host were you connected to? Log out.
1. Connect to `login.itd.umich.edu` using `ssh`. Which host were you connected to? Log out an connect again. Were you connected to the same host?

## ![](../icons/Observe.png){width='25px'} File system  

In Linux essentially everything is a file: this includes program executables,
system configurations, as well as your own data and source files. 

Files are organized hierarchically into directories beginning with the *root* directory `/`. Directories can contain files and subdirectories with locations in the directory hierarchy separated by a `/`. This collection of directories and files is called a *file tree*.

Use the following commands to navigate and interact with the file tree:

 + `ls` (list files), `ls -a`, `ls -l`
 + `cd` (change directories)
 + `pwd` (print the current or *working* directory)
 + `mkdir` (make directory), `mkdir -p`
 + `rmdir` (remove directory)
 + `rm` (remove a file), `rm -r`
 + `mv` Move a file or directory
 + `find` Find a file.
 
In working with files, it is helpful to know:

 + `.` refers to the current directory,
 + `..` refers to the parent directory, one step up the file tree.
 + `cd` invoked with no arguments will return you to your home directory.
 + Configuration files and others used by programs are often name as *hidden files* whose filenames begin with a `.`. To see these files, use `ls -a`.
 + Use *filename wildcards* to refer to groups of files matching specific patterns:
    - `*` matches any sequence of characters
    - `?` matches any single character.

### Environment variables

Enviroment variables determine certain aspects of how the OS behaves and 
responds to your instructions.  Here are a couple of important ones:

 + HOME  (location of your home directory)
 + SHELL (the shell you are using to interface with the machine)
 + PATH  (locations to search for executable programs)

In the [Bash shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html), use `$` to access the value of an environment variable. The `echo` command can be used to print these values to the screen  `echo $SHELL`. 
 
Use `which` to search your `$PATH` for an executable command. 

A tilde `~` will often be expanded as `$HOME`.

### Resources

For more see the [GNU Coreutils documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/coreutils.html)

## ![](../icons/Observe.png){width='25px'} Terminal Multiplexers 

A terminal multiplexer allows you to invoke multiple shells from the same terminal connection and to keep these sessions running after you log off.
The two most common are `screen` and `tmux`, with the latter being the preferred option for this course.  

When using a terminal multiplexer with a networked file system such as AFS,
be aware that your credentials or "ticket" for accessing the networked files will typically expire after a fixed amount of time (e.g. 24 hours). You can renew this ticket for a fixed amount of time using `kinit`:

```bash
kinit -4d
aklog
```

##  ![](../icons/Observe.png){width='25px'} Transferring data 

There are many ways to transfer data to a remote server using the shell.  Three common ways to do this from the command line are: 
  
  +`scp` to copy to/from your local computer, 
  
  +`wget` to download directly from the web, 
  
  +`sftp` or 'secure file transfer protocol' for transferring large volumes of data.
  
To transfer a single smallish file from the working directory
on your local machine to your AFS space:

```bash
scp ./local_file.ext uniqname@scs.dsc.umich.edu:~/remote_directory/
```

To transfer a file from the remote directory to your local computer reverse
the arguments:

```bash
scp uniqname@scs.dsc.umich.edu:~/remote_directory/remote_file.ext ./
```
For larger transfers you should use `sftp` for efficiency and to avoid 
adding strain to the computation servers.

To download data directly from a website to a remote server use a web browser to find the URL to the file and use `wget`:

```bash
wget https://remote.url.edu/path/to/file/data.txt
```
Make sure you are only downloading only from trusted sources!

##  ![](../icons/Observe.png){width='25px'} Compression and archiving

Large files often contain redundant data and can be stored
using less space on disk in a compressed format. 
Depending on the system and the file, compression can make
reading from or writing to a file more efficient as reading 
the bits off disk is  "I/O bound" while decoding/decompressing is 
"CPU bound".  This is particularly 
useful on shared systems with I/O bottlenecks.

### Disk utilization

The `du` or disk utilization utility can be used to see the space 
on disk used by a file or set of files. Use the `-h` option to print values
in *human* readable units.  Use `-s` to get *sum* totals for a directory.

### gzip

There are many compression tools, one of the most popular is `gzip`. The command,

```bash
gzip file.txt
```
compresses `file.txt` into `file.gz`.

The file can be uncompressed using,

```bash
gunzip file.gz
```
the original extension is stored in the compressed file.

You can retain the compressed copy and unzip directly to standard output using
the `-c` option:

```bash
gunzip -c file.gz > file.txt
```

### tar

A *tarball* is an archive of a file tree and often compressed.  
This can be useful for transferring directories between machines manually.  
It is also a way to cleanly archive files from projects you would like to 
retain, but no longer need to use 
frequently. Many programs have the ability to work directly with archived 
and/or compressed data.

The two most common use cases are creating an archive,

```bash
tar cvfz name.tgz ./parent_folder
```

and extracting the archive,

```bash
tar xvfz name.tgz
```

The extension `.tgz` is short for `.tar.gz` indicating that the archive has been compressed using `gzip`.

## ![](../icons/Observe.png){width='25px'} Other common tools  

You may at times find the following command line tools useful:

  + sort - sort a file on or more fields
  
  + cut -  extract select columns from a delimted file
  
  + paste - concatenate files line by line 
  
  + join - merge two files based on a common field.

We will look at examples in class as time permits.

## ![](../icons/Observe.png){width='25px'} Shell scripting 

A shell script is a program constructed from shell commands.  You can view
an example [here](./student_dir.sh).
