## Overview

SAS is closed source commercial software widely used by industry.  For instance,
SAS promotional materials claim 83,000 installations including most of the top 100
companies from the Fortune 500.  It is also quite popular in bio statistics and
the healthcare industry.

Our examples will largely be based on Professor Shedden's 2016 course [notes](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~kshedden/Courses/Stat506/sas_intro/)
and [case studies](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~kshedden/Courses/Stat506/sas_flights/).
Please his course notes as your primary resource and think of the below as supplementary examples.

## Accessing SAS

You have several options for accessing SAS for learning and
assignments.  All examples shown in class will use SAS in batch mode as that is the way I 
primarily use it. 

### Batch Mode

You can use SAS in batch mode on the scs servers:

```bash
ssh luigi.dsc.umich.edu
sas Example0.SAS -log Example0.log
```

Several versions of SAS are also available on Flux (`module load SAS`).

### Graphical User Interfaces

SAS offers a free ["University Edition"](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html) for academic use. 

You can also access SAS using [midesktop](https://midesktop.umich.edu/portal/webclient/index.html#/) through the UM computing service.
You will need to figure out the details yourself if you choose this route.

## Resources

 + SAS offers an extensive set of free [trainings](http://support.sas.com/training/) through their website.

## Examples 

You can download all of the examples and data shown below as a tar ball from [www-personal.jbhender.umich.edu/sas_examples.tgz](www-personal.jbhender.umich.edu/sas_examples.tgz).

From the SCS servers, you can also copy this directly from my public AFS space:

```bash
cp //afs/umich.edu/user/j/b/jbhender/Public/html/sas_examples.tgz ~/
```

To extract the files from the archive use:

```
tar xvfz sas_examples.tgz
```

This will create a folder 'SAS' so be sure you do not already have a folder
of that name in the directory you extract to.

### Writing A Basic SAS program

This [video](http://video.sas.com/detail/videos/how-to-tutorials/video/4573016765001/writing-a-basic-sas-program?autoStart=true) explains the basics of a SAS program and how to write one using SAS studio.

Here are some key points to keep in mind:

  + Most SAS programs are composed of "data" and "proc" steps.
  + SAS statements are delimited by a semicolon ";".
  + A "run;" statement tells SAS to execute a block of code.
  + After code is run, a log file contains information about its execution 
  including any errors.  R users may wish to think of this as containing "messages" and "warnings".
  + The role of the "data output" window in the video is played by a "listing" (.lst) file
   in batch mode.
  + SAS statements are not case sensitive.
  + SAS is primarily a _declarative_ language.

### Importing Data

This script uses `proc import` to import a comma delimited 
copy of the [RECS](http://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2009/index.cfm?view=microdata) 
data. We then use `proc print` and `proc contents` to explore it.

[example0.SAS](./SAS/examples/example0.SAS); [example0.lst](./SAS/out/example0.lst)

### Libraries

SAS uses a binary format `sas7bdat` for native data storage on disk. SAS also
uses the concept of 'libraries' similar to how schema are used in SQL. The default
library is `WORK` set up in a temporary directory.  You create _handles_ for libraries
using a `libname` statement.

In example 1, we create a library handle `mylib` and save the RECS data to it
after importing.

[example1.SAS](./SAS/examples/example1.SAS)

In example 2, we create a data table `recs` referencing the RECS data in 
sas7bdat format downloaded from the EIA site. Note the additional metadata
it contains relative to the version imported from CSV.

[example2.SAS](./SAS/examples/example2.SAS); [example2.lst](./SAS/out/example2.lst)

### Subsetting data

In example 3 we create rural and urban subsets of the RECS data an save them
to our library using "`data`" steps.

[example3.SAS](./SAS/examples/example3.SAS)

### Descriptive Statistics

There are several procedures useful for obtaining descriptive statistics.

In example 4 we explore `proc tabulate`. 

[example4.SAS](./SAS/examples/example4.SAS); [example4.lst](./SAS/out/example4.lst)

In example 5 we explore `proc means`,
`proc summary` and `proc freq`.  

[example5.SAS](./SAS/examples/example5.SAS); [example5.lst](./SAS/out/example5.lst)

### Split, apply, combine

An important difference between `proc means` and
`proc summary` is that the former computes output to be printed to the listing file while the
latter constructs a table of summary statistics. The latter is thus useful for implementing
the "split, apply, combine" pattern.  We revisit the "roof types" problem in example 6.
