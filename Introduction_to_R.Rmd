```

## About R

```{r, out.width="100px", out.height="100px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/Rlogo.png")
```

As decribed by [The R Foundation](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), 
"R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics." 
Importantly, R is open-source, free software distributed under a GNU GPL-3 license. 

It is also easily extensible through contributed packages that cover much of modern
statistics and data science.

### RStudio

[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is an "integrated development environment" for working with R that 
simplifies many tasks and makes for a friendlier introduction to R. It provides a nice
interface via [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for integrating R code with text for creating documents. 
RStudio is distributed by a company of the same name that also offers a number of related
products for working with data: Shiny for interactive graphics along with 
enterprise and server editions. I suggest you use RStudio when feasible
to streamline your workflow. 

### Computing experience survey.

Based on the computing experience survey, most of you have used R before:

<div style = "text-align: center;">
```{r, out.width="600px", out.height="100px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/SurveyR.png")
```
</div>

As such, we will skip some of the basics and move quickly through other introductory 
material.  If you

### R Basics {.tabset}

#### Lesson 1: Getting Started
##### Objectves
  + Understand:
      + How objects are created and used
  + Be able to:
      + View and clear the global environment
      + Use **R** for simple arithmetic calculations

##### Objects
Everything in **R** is an object that can be referred to by name. We create
objects by assigning values to them:

```{r,1}
# This is a comment ignored by R
Instructor <- 'Dr. Henderson'
x <- 10
y <- 32
z <- c(x,y) #Form vectors by combining or concatenting elements.

9 -> w # This works, but is bad style.
TheAnswer = 42 # Most other languages use = for assignemnt.
```

The values can be referred to by the object name:

```{r,2}
TheAnswer
```

Objects are stored by value and __not__ by reference:
```{r,3}
z <- c(x,y)
c(x,y,z)
y=TheAnswer
c(x,y,z)
```

In contrast, if `z <- c(x,y)` were a reference to the contents of `x` and `y` then
changing `y` would change `z` the value refered to by `z` as well.

##### Arithmetic
**R** can do arithmetic with objects that contain numeric types.
```{r,4}
x + y
z / x
z^2
z + 2*c(y,x) - 10  

11 %% 2   # Modular arithmetic
11 %/% 2 # Integer division returns remainder
```

Be careful about mixing vectors of different lengths as **R** will generally
recycle values:

```{r,5}
x <- 4:6
y <- c(0,1)
x*y
```


```{r,6}
x <- 1:4
y*x
```

There are a number of common mathematical functions already in **R**:
```{r,7}
mean(x) # average
sum(x)  # summation
sd(x)   # Standard deviation
var(x)  # Variance
exp(x)  # Exponential
sqrt(x) # Square root
log(x)  # Natural log
sin(x)  # Trigonometric functions
cos(pi/2) # R even contains pi, but only does finite arithmetic
```

##### Global Environment
The values are stored in a workspace called the global environment. You can
view objects in the global environment using the function 'ls()' and remove objects
using 'rm()':

```{r,8}
ls()
rm(w)
ls()
```

We can remove multiple objects in a few ways:
```{r,9}
remove(Instructor,TheAnswer) # remove and rm are synonyms
ls()
rm(list=c('x','y')) # Object names are passed to list as strings
ls()
```

To clear the entire workspace use 'rm(list=ls())':
```{r,10}
ls()
rm(list=ls())
ls()
```

##### More on objects
Functions are also objects:
```{r,11}
ViewGlobalEnv <- ls
ViewGlobalEnv()
```

Elements of vectors can be given names:
```{r,12}
z = c('x'=10,'y'=42)
names(z)
names(z) <- c('Xval','Yval'); names(z)
unname(z)
```

Use `quit()` to quit **R**. Use `help()` or `?function` to get help.
