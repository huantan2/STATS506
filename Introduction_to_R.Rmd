```

## About R

```{r, out.width="100px", out.height="100px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/Rlogo.png")
```

As decribed by [The R Foundation](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), 
"R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics." 
Importantly, R is open-source, free software distributed under a GNU GPL-3 license. 

It is also easily extensible through contributed packages that cover much of modern
statistics and data science.

### RStudio

[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is an "integrated development environment" for working with R that 
simplifies many tasks and makes for a friendlier introduction to R. It provides a nice
interface via [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for integrating R code with text for creating documents. 
RStudio is distributed by a company of the same name that also offers a number of related
products for working with data: Shiny for interactive graphics along with 
enterprise and server editions. I suggest you use RStudio when feasible
to streamline your workflow. 

### Computing experience survey.

Based on the computing experience survey, most of you have used R before:

<div style = "text-align: center;">
```{r, out.width="600px", out.height="100px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/SurveyR.png")
```
</div>

As such, we will skip some of the basics and move quickly through other introductory 
material. 

## Topics {.tabset}
### R Basics {.tabset}

#### Getting Started
##### Objectves
  + Understand:
      + How objects are created and used.
  + Be able to:
      + View and clear the global environment.
      + Use **R** for simple arithmetic calculations.

##### Objects
Everything in **R** is an object that can be referred to by name. We create
objects by assigning values to them:

```{r,1}
# This is a comment ignored by R
Instructor <- 'Dr. Henderson'
x <- 10
y <- 32
z <- c(x,y) #Form vectors by combining or concatenting elements.

9 -> w # This works, but is bad style.
TheAnswer = 42 # Most other languages use = for assignemnt.
```

The values can be referred to by the object name:

```{r,2}
TheAnswer
```

Objects can be any syntacticaly [valid](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/make.names.html)
name. You should, however, avoid clobbering built in `R` names such as `pi`, `mean` or `sum`.
You also should not use [reserved words](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Reserved.html) when naming objects.

Finally, it is important to remember that in **R** objects are stored by value and __not__ by reference:
```{r,3}
z <- c(x,y)
c(x,y,z)
y=TheAnswer
c(x,y,z)
```

In contrast, if `z <- c(x,y)` were a reference to the contents of `x` and `y` then
changing `y` would change `z` the value refered to by `z` as well.

##### Arithmetic
**R** can do arithmetic with objects that contain numeric types.
```{r,4}
x + y
z / x
z^2
z + 2*c(y,x) - 10  

11 %% 2   # Modular arithmetic (i.e. what is the remainder)
11 %/% 2  # Integer division discards the remainder 
```

Be careful about mixing vectors of different lengths as **R** will generally
recycle values:

```{r,5}
x <- 4:6
y <- c(0,1)
x*y
```


```{r,6}
x <- 1:4
y*x
```

There are a number of common mathematical functions already in **R**:
```{r,7}
mean(x) # average
sum(x)  # summation
sd(x)   # Standard deviation
var(x)  # Variance
exp(x)  # Exponential
sqrt(x) # Square root
log(x)  # Natural log
sin(x)  # Trigonometric functions
cos(pi/2) # R even contains pi, but only does finite arithmetic
```

##### Global Environment
The values are stored in a workspace called the global environment. You can
view objects in the global environment using the function 'ls()' and remove objects
using 'rm()':

```{r,8}
ls()
rm(w)
ls()
```

We can remove multiple objects in a few ways:
```{r,9}
remove(Instructor,TheAnswer) # remove and rm are synonyms
ls()
rm(list=c('x','y')) # Object names are passed to list as strings
ls()
```

To clear the entire workspace use 'rm(list=ls())':
```{r,10}
ls()
rm(list=ls())
ls()
```

##### More on objects
Functions are also objects:
```{r,11}
ViewGlobalEnv <- ls
ViewGlobalEnv()
```

Elements of vectors can be given names:
```{r,12}
z = c('x'=10,'y'=42)
names(z)
names(z) <- c('Xval','Yval'); names(z)
unname(z)
```

Use `quit()` to quit **R**. Use `help()` or `?function` to get help.

#### Logicals & Indexing

##### Logicals

**R** has three reserved words of type 'logical':

```{r}
typeof(TRUE)
typeof(FALSE)
typeof(NA)
if(TRUE && T){
  print('Synonyms')
}
if(FALSE || F){
  print('Synonyms')
}
```

While 'T' and 'F' are equivalent to 'TRUE' and 'FALSE' it is best to always 
use the full words. You should also avoid using 'T' or 'F' as names for objects or
function arguments.

##### Boolean comparisons

Boolean operators are useful for generating values conditionally on other values.
Here are the basics:

 Operator | Meaning 
-----------|-------
`==` | equal
`!=` | not equal
`>`, `>=` | greater than (or equal to)
`<`, `<=` | less than (or equal to)
 `&&` | scalar AND
 `||` | scalar OR
 `&` | vectorized AND
 `|` | vectorized OR
 `!`  | negation (`!TRUE == FALSE` and `!FALSE == TRUE`)
 `any()` | are ANY of the elements true
 `all()` | are ALL of the elements true
 
Logicals are created by Boolean comparisons:

```{r}
{2*3} == 6     # test equality with ==
{2+2} != 5     # use != for 'not equal'
sqrt(69) > 8   # comparison operators: >, >=, <, <=
sqrt(64) >= 8  
!{2==3}        # Use not to negate or 'flip' a logical
```

Comparison operators are vectorized:
```{r}
1:10 > 5
```

You can can combine operators using 'and (&&)' or 'or (||)':
```{r}
{2+2}==4 | {2+2}==5 # An or statement asks if either statement is true
{2+2}==4 & {2+2}==5 # And requires both to be true
```

Note the difference between the single and double versions:

```{r}
even <- {1:10 %% 2} == 0
div4 <- {1:10 %% 4} == 0

even | div4
even || div4

even & div4
even && div4
```

Use `any` or `all` to efficiently check for the presence of any `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
```{r}
any(even)
all(even)
```

##### Using which
The 'which()' function returns the elements of a logical vector that return true:
```{r}
which({1:5}^2 > 10)
```

A combination of which and logicals can be used to subset data frames:

```{r}
head(mtcars)
mtcars[which(mtcars$mpg>30),]
```

#### Functions

##### Objectves
  + Understand:
      + How **R** knows to interpret something as a function. 
      + How arguments passed to functions are interpreted.
  + Be able to:
      + Write and call a function.

##### Functions
As we saw in "Getting Started", **R** 
identifies functions by the 'func()' construction. Functions 
are simply collections of commands that do something.  Functions take *arguments* 
which can be used to specify *which* objects to operate on and *what* values of parameters
are used. You can use 'help(func)' to see what a function is used for and what arguments it expects, i.e. `help(sprintf)`.


##### Arguments

Functions will often have multiple arguments.  Some arguments have default values, others do not.
All arguments without default values must be passed to a function. 
Arguments can be passed by name or position. For instance,

```{r,14}
x <- runif(n=5, min=0, max=1)
y <- runif(5, 0, 1)
z <- runif(5)
round(cbind(x, y, z), 1)
```
both generate 5 numbers from a Uniform(0,1) distribution.  

Arguments passed by name need not be in order:
```{r,15}
w <- runif(min=0, max=1, n=5)
u <- runif(min=0, max=1, 5) # This also works but is bad style. 
round(rbind(u=u, w=w), 1)
```

##### Writing Functions
You can create your own functions in **R**. Use functions for tasks that you repeat
often in order to make your scripts more easily readable and modifiable. A good rule
of thumb is never to copy an paste more than twice; use a function instead.  It can
also be a good practice to use functions to break complex processes into parts, especially
if these parts are used with control flow statements such as loops or conditionals.

```{r,16-z-score1}
# function to compute z-scores
zScore1 <- function(x){
  xbar <- mean(x)
  s <- sd(x)
  z <- (x - mean(x)) / s
  return(z)  
}
```

The return statement is not strictly necessary, but can make complex functions more
readable. It is good practice to avoid creating intermediate objects to store values only used once.  
```{r,17-z-score2}
# function to compute z-scores
zScore2 <- function(x){
  {x - mean(x)} / sd(x)
}
```

```{r,18}
x <- rnorm(10,3,1) ## generate some normally distributed values
round(cbind(x, 'Z1'=zScore1(x), 'Z2'=zScore2(x)), 1)
```

##### Default parameters
We can set default values for parameters using the construction 'parameter = xx' in the 
function definition.

```{r,19-z-score3}
# function to compute z-scores
zScore3 <- function(x, na.rm=T){
  {x - mean(x, na.rm=na.rm)} / sd(x, na.rm=na.rm)
}
```

```{r,20}
x <- c(NA,x,NA)
round(cbind(x,'Z1'=zScore1(x),'Z2'=zScore2(x),'Z3'=zScore3(x)),1)
```

##### Scope

Scoping refers to how R looks up the value associated with an object referred to 
by name.  There are two types of scoping -- lexical and dynamic -- but we will 
concern ourselves only with lexical scoping here.  There are four keys to
understanding scoping:
 
  + environments
  + name masking
  + variables vs functions
  + dynamic lookup and lazy evaluation.

An environment can be thought of as context in which a name for an object makes sense.
Each time a function is called, it generates a new environment for the computation.

Consider the follwing examples:
```{r}
ls()
f1 <- function(){
  f1_message = "Im defined inside of f!"  # `message` is a function in base
  ls()
}
f1()
exists('f1')
exists('f1_message')

environment()
f2 <- function(){
  environment()
}
f2()
rm(f1,f2)
```

Name masking refers to where and in what order **R** looks for object names.  
When we call `f1` above, **R** first looks in the current environment which
happens to be the global environment. The call to `ls()` however, happens within
the environment created by the function call and hence returns only the objects
defined in the local environment. 

When an environment is created, it gets nested within the current environment referred
to as the "parent environemnt". When an object is referenced we first look in
the current environment and move recursively up through parent environments until 
we find a value bound to that name.

Name masking refers to the notion that objects of the same name can exist in different
environments.  Consider these examples:

```{r}
y <- x <- 'I came from outside of f!'
f3 <- function(){
  x <- 'I came from inside of x!'
  list(x=x,y=y)
}
f3()
x

mean <- function(x){sum(x)}
mean(1:10)
base::mean(1:10)
rm(mean)
```

**R** also uses dynamic lookup, meaning values are searched for when a function is called
and not when it is created. In the example above, `y` was defined in the global
environment rather than within the function body. This means the value returned by
`f3` depends on the value of `y` in the global environment. You should generally avoid
this, but there are occasions where it can be useful.

```{r}
y <- "I have been reinvented!"
f3()
```

Finally, lazy evaluation means **R** only evaluates function arguments if/when they
are actually used.

```{r}
f4 <- function(x){
  #x
  45
}
f4(x=stop("Let's pass an error."))
```
Uncomment `x` to see what happens if we evlauate it.

##### Resources
Read more about functions [here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html) and [here](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functions.html#lazy-evaluation).

The second link is to Chapter 6 from the optional text "Advanced R".

You can also read much more about functions in Chapter 7 of "The Art of R Programming."

##### Practice

1. Access and skim the help pages for 'median()', 'mad()', and 'IQR'.
2. Write a function 'zScoreRobust' that accepts a numeric vector and returns robust z-scores.
3. Make the function you wrote robust to vectors containing "NA" values
4. Generate some data from N(4,2) to test your functions.
5. View the function at this [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbhender/Stats506/master/tbd.R)
and answer the questions in the comments.

#### Conditionals
In programming, we often need to execute a piece of code only if some condition is
true.  Here are some of the **R** tools for doing this.

##### if statements
The workhorse for conditional execution in **R** is the `if` statement.  In the syntax below, note
the spacing around the condtion enclosed in the parantheses.  

```{r}
if (TRUE) {
  print('do something if true')
}
```

There are different opions on whether to use the above or this:
```{r}
if(TRUE){
  print('do something if true')
}
```

You can choose a style of your choosing, but be _consistent_. Occasionally,
with short statements it can be idomatic to include the condition on the same line
without the braces:

```{r}
if(TRUE) print('do something if true')
```

Use an `else` to control the flow without separately checking the conditon's negation:
```{r}
if ({2+2}==5) {
  print('the statement is true')
} else {
  print('the statement is false')
}

result <- c(4,5)
report = ifelse({2+2}==result, 'true', 'false')
report
```

As you can see above, there is also an `ifelse` function that can be useful. 

For more complex cases, you may want to check multiple condtions:

```{r}
a = -1
b = 1
if (a*b > 0) {
  print('Zero is not between a and b')
} else if (a < b) {
    smaller = a
    larger = b
} else {
    smaller = b
    larger  = a
}

```

In all of the examples above, please pay close attention to the use 
of indentation for clariy. 

##### switch
Use a switch when you have mulitple discrete options.

Here is a simple example:
```{r}
cases = function(x) {
  switch(as.character(x),
    a=1,
    b=2,
    c=3,
    "Neither a, b, nor c."
  )
}
cases("a")
cases("m")
cases(8)
```

Without the coercion, the final call will evaluate to `NULL`.

```{r}
cases2 = function(x) {
  switch(x,
    a=1,
    b=2,
    c=3,
    "Neither a, b, nor c."
  )
}
cases(8)
```

A `switch` can also be used with a numeric expression,
```{r}
for(i in c(-1:3, 9))  print(switch(i, 1, 2 , 3, 4))
```

Here is a more useful example:
```{r}
mySummary <- function(x){
  switch(class(x),
         factor=table(x),
         numeric=sprintf('mean=%4.2f,sd=%4.2f', mean(x), sd(x)),
          'Only defined for factor and numeric classes.')
}
for ( var in names(iris) ) {
  cat(var, ':\n', sep='')
  print( mySummary(iris[,var]) )
}
```

##### practice

1. Read the R code below and determine the value of `twos` and `threes` at the end.

```r
twos = 0
threes = 0
for (i in 1:10) {
  if (i %% 2 == 0) {
    twos = twos + i
  } else if (i %% 3 == 0) {
    threes = threes + i 
  }
}
```

2. Read the R code below and determine the value of `x` at the end.

```r
x = 0
for (i in 1:10) {
  x = x + switch(1 + {i %% 3}, 1, 5, 10)
}
```

#### Control Statments {.tabset}

##### for loops
Here is the syntax for a basic for loop in **R**

```{r}
for ( i in 1:10 ) {
   cat(i,'\n')
}
```

Note that the loop and the *iterator* are evaluated within the global environment.

```{r}
for (var in names(mtcars)) {
  cat( sprintf('average %s = %4.3f', var, mean(mtcars[,var])), '\n')
}
```

##### while 
A while statement can be useful when you aren't sure how many iterations are needed.  
Here is an example that takes a random walk and terminates if the value is
more than 10 units from 0.

```{r}
maxIter <- 1e3 # always limit the total iterations allowed
val = vector(mode='numeric', length=maxIter)
val[1] = rnorm(1) ## intialize
k = 1
while ( abs(val[k]) < 10 & k <= maxIter ) {
  val[k+1] = val[k] + rnorm(1)
  k = k + 1
}
val = val[1:{k-1}]
plot(val, type='l')
```

##### key words
The following key words are useful within loops:
  
  + `break` - break out of the currently excuting loop
  + `next` - move to the next iteration immediately, without executing 
  the rest of this iteration (`continue` in other languages such as C++)

Here is an example using `next`:
```{r}
for (i in 1:10) {
  if (i %% 2 == 0) next
  cat(i,'\n')
}
```

Here is an example using `break`:

```{r}
x = c()
for (i in 1:1e1) {
  if (i %% 3 == 0) break
  x = c(x,i)
}
print(x)
```

##### practice
The Fibonacci sequence starts 1, 1, 2, ... and continues with each new value formed by adding the two previous values.

1. Write a function 'Fib1' which takes an argument 'n' and returns the $n^{th}$ value of the Fibonacci sequence. Use a for loop in the function.

2. Write a function 'Fib2' which does the same thing using a while loop.

3. Use a switch to write a function that has a parameter `loop = c('for', 'while')` for calling either `Fib1` or `Fib2`.

#### Important Classes {.tabset}
##### Matrices
Matrices are two-dimensional vectors organized into rows and columns. They always contain values of a single type.

Matrices are stored using 'column-major ordering' meaning that by default they are filled and operated on by column.
```{r}
X <- matrix(1:10,nrow=5,ncol=2)
Y <- matrix(1:10,nrow=5,ncol=2,byrow = TRUE)
X
Y
class(X)
```

**R** can do matrix multiplication and many other linear algebra computations.

```{r}
X %*% t(Y)
3*X
c(1,2)*Y
```

Matrices have both dimension and length.
```{r}
dim(X)
length(X)
as.vector(X)
c(nrow(X),ncol(X))
```

```{r}
colnames(X) <- paste('Col',1:2,sep='')
rownames(X) <- letters[1:5]
X["a",]
X[1:3,'Col2']
```

##### Arrays
See 'help(arrays)'.

##### Multiple types {.tabset}

###### Lists
In **R** a list is a generic container for storing values of multiple types. 

```{r}
myList <- list(Name='An example list',
               Matrix=diag(5),
               n=5
               )
myList
class(myList)
length(myList)
names(myList)
```

You can access a specific element in a list by position or name:
```{r}
myList[['Name']]
myList$Matrix
```
Note the use of double brackets ('[['n']]) and compare to the single bracket case below.

```{r}
class(myList['n'])
class(myList[['n']])
```

###### Data Frames

Data frame are perhaps the most common way to represent a data set in **R**. A data frame is like a matrix with observations or units in rows and variables in columns.  It doesn't require the columns to all be of the same type.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(ID=1:10,
                 Group=
                   sample(0:1,10,replace=TRUE),
                 Var1=rnorm(10),
                 Var2=seq(0,1,length.out=10),
                 Var3=factor(
                   rep(c('a','b'),each=5)
                   )
                )
names(df)
dim(df)
length(df)
nrow(df)

```

We can access the values of a data frame both like a list:
```{r}
df$ID
df[['Var3']]
```
or like a matrix
```{r}
df[1:5,]
df[,'Var2']
```

#### Apply

Loops in **R** can be quite slow compared to other programming language on account of the overhead of many of the conveniences that make it useful for routine data analysis.  Often, explicit loops can be avoided by using an 'apply' function.

Here is an example:
```{r}
X = matrix(rep(1:5,each=5),5,5)
apply(X,1,sum)
apply(X,2,sum)
```

For lists use 'lapply()' or 'sapply()'. 
```{r}
myList=list(x=1:5,y=-5:-1)
lapply(myList,sum)
sapply(myList,sum)
```

The values in a data.frame are represented internally as a list, so use lapply with data frames.

```{r}
head(iris)
sapply(iris,class)
apply(iris,2,class)
```

A very powerful construction for data manipulation is the use of apply with an implicit function.

```{r}
sapply(mtcars,function(x){
  nVals = length(unique(x))
  return(nVals)
})
```


##### Exercises

1. Use apply to get the class of each variable in the 'mtcars' data set.
2. Use apply to find the row means and column means of the 'attitude' data.

### Packages 

#### Objectives:
  + Understand:
    + Basics of the **R** package system
    + What it means for a function to be 'masked'
  + Be able to:
    + Install packages
    + Make a package available to R
    + Call functions from packages without loading
    + Remove packages

#### The **R** package system

Much of the utility of **R** is derived from an extensive collection of user
and domain-expert contributed packages. Packages are simply a standardized way
for people to share *documented* code and data. There are thousands of packages!

Packages are primarily distributed through three sources:

  + [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) 
  + [Github](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html)
  + [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/)

##### Installing packages
The primary way to install a package is using 'install.packages("pkg")'.
```{r,21}
#install.packages('lme4') # the package name should be passed as a character string
```

You can find the default location for your **R** packages using the `.libPaths()`
function. If you don't have write permission to this folder, you can set this directory
to a personal library instead.
```{r,22}
.libPaths() ## The default library location
.libPaths('/Users/jbhender/Rlib') #Create the directory first!
.libPaths()
```
To install a package to a personal library use the 'lib' option.
```{r,23}
## install.packages("haven",lib='/Users/jbhender/Rlib')
```

If your computer has the necessary tools, packages can also be installed from source by downloading the package file and pointing directly to the source tar ball ('.tgz') or Windows binary.  

#### Using packages in **R**
Installing a package does not make it available to **R**! There are two ways to
use things from a package: 

  + calling `library("pkg")` to add it to the search path
  + using the `pkg::function` construction.

These methods are illustrated below using the data set 'InstEval' distributed
with the 'lme4' package.

```{r,24}
#head(InstEval)
## Using the pkg::function construction
head(lme4::InstEval)
```

The `library("pkg")` command adds a package to the search path.
```{r,25}
search()
library(lme4)
search()
head(InstEval)
```

To remove a library from the search path use `detach("package:pkg", unload=TRUE)`.
```{r,26}
detach(package:lme4, unload=TRUE)
search()
```
