## Git for Version Control

A version control system is a tool for managing changes to computer code over 
time by efficiently tracking changes all modifications.  One of the most popular
version of version control is "git".  Other version control systems such as
subversion or SVN are also widely used, but "git" has become a de facto standard.
Git generally is already installed on most linux-like systems.

Version control is essential for projects with multiple people editing
the same collection of code.  However, it can also help even a single user more 
effectivley and efficiently manage and document their own scripts and programs.

## Git from the command line

To begin tracking an existing project, move to the top folder in the
project tree and type:

```
git init
```

To create a local copy of an existing repository:

```
git clone "url for repo"
```

For example, to clone the "Stats506_F17" repository from gihtub.com:

```
git clone https://github.com/jbhender/Stats506_17
```


## Repositories

Git is a "distributed version control system" meaning that all copies are "local".
When you a version controlled project using git, the project folder is itself
a respository. You do not ne

However, git is used most effectively with a remote repository.  Remote git
respositories suach as <a href="https://github.com">github</a> or 
<a href="https://bitbucket.org">bitbucket</a> are effective means for both backing up
and sharing the code you write.  It is also a great way to manage work across multiple
computers, such as a personal laptop and one or more servers.

### git for remote repositories

The following commands are useful for working with a remote repository.

To link a local and remote repository, use `git remote`:

```
git remote -u origin master 
```

If you haven't made any local commits and want to bring your local copy up to date
with the remote repository use, `git pull`. To retrieve remote changes without
merging into the local repostitory use `git fetch` followed by `git status` or 
`git diff` to see changes that have been made. You can then use `git merge` or
`git pull` to finish merging.

### Caution

When using a remote code repository like github or bitbucket be careful not to
submit any protected or senstive data. When working with such data, it is 
especially important to use `git status` before `git pull` to ensure you know
exactly what will be uploaded to a remote repository.

Similary, when working on a project for someone
else be sure to check whether there is any concern about sharing the code in a public 
or private repository.
