## Hadoop

Hadoop is software with the goal of enabling processing for very large amounts of data by distributing both the data and the processing across many ("thousands") of servers.  

Here is the description from the hadoop manual (`man hadoop`):

```
DESCRIPTION
  Here's what makes Hadoop especially useful:

       Here's what makes Hadoop especially
       useful:

       Scalable
           Hadoop can reliably store and
           process petabytes.

       Economical
           It distributes the data and pro‐
           cessing across clusters of commonly
           available computers. These clusters
           can number into the thousands of
           nodes.

       Efficient
           By distributing the data, Hadoop
           can process it in parallel on the
           nodes where the data is located.
           This makes it extremely rapid.

       Reliable
           Hadoop automatically maintains mul‐
           tiple copies of data and automati‐
           cally redeploys computing tasks
           based on failures.
```

Hadoop consists of two main components the HDFS file system and a resource manager called
YARN.

### HDFS

HDFS is an acronym for *Hadoop Distributed File System*.  The file system is 

This file system is structured similarly to a Linux alike system, but it is not a POSIX file system.  

However, most common linux file system commands have implementations within the `hdfs dfs` command. 

For instance, the following commands would create a directory with my uniqname within an hdfs `/user/` directory.

```
hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/jbhender
```

Local data `example.csv` could then be placed into this directory using `-put`.

```
hdfs dfs -put ./example.csv example.csv
```

See the examples that have been put there: 

```
hdfs dfs -ls /user/jbhender/
```

And, after some processing, maybe extract a results file back to the local directory.

```
hdfs dfs -get results.csv results.csv
```
Learn more about HDFS at the Apache [website](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.5.2/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/FileSystemShell.html).


## YARN

YARN is the hadoop resource manager similar to the role played by Moab/TORQUE/PBS job scheduling system used on Flux.

## MapReduce

Hadoop is designed to implement the [MapReduce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce) abstraction for data processing.  Under the map reduce paradigm, data processing tasks are split into multiple smaller jobs which can be executed in parallel using local subsets of data -- this is the map step -- with the results then aggregated in a "reduce" step.
