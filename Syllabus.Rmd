## Course Description: 
Statistics 506 covers a variety of topics related to the use of computing for analyzing,
managing, and presenting data. We will cover the topics below along with several case studies:

  + Overview of computing languages for statistical computing
  + General computing:
    - Linux shell and utilities
    - Version control with git
    - Literate programming
    - Testing, verifying, and profiling code
  + Basic computer architecture and networking
  + Basic Stata
  + Basic and advanced R:
    - R basics
    - Rmarkdown
    - Vectorization, functions
    - dplyr and other tools for split/apply/combine in R
    - the R package system
    - Rcpp, using C/C++ within R
    - parallel and concurrent programming in R
  + Basic SAS
  + SQL
  + Batch computing and job scheduling (PBS)
  + Distributed computing (Spark/Hadoop)

## Computing Resources

All of the software in this course is available without charge for UM students.
Some software, such as R, is free and open source and can be installed on your
personal machine. You should install both R and RStudio as described in steps
1 and 2 <a href="https://jbhender.github.io/R_Workshop_Prep.html">here</a>.
